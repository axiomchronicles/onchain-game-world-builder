# NEAR AI Gaming Metaverse

## Overview
This project is a smart contract for an AI gaming metaverse built on the NEAR blockchain. It allows users to create and manage virtual worlds, mint game assets, edit world details, manage user profiles, log activities, and implement monetization strategies.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following modules:

- **World Creation**: Manage the creation and retrieval of virtual worlds.
- **Game Assets**: Mint and manage NFTs associated with worlds.
- **World Editing**: Update and delete world details.
- **User Profiles**: Handle user registration and profile management.
- **Activity Logging**: Log user actions within worlds.
- **Monetization**: Implement tipping and reward claiming functionalities.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types for graceful error management.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Install Rust and the NEAR CLI.
   - Create a new Rust project using:
     ```
     cargo new near-ai-gaming-metaverse
     ```

2. **Define Dependencies**:
   - In `Cargo.toml`, add the following dependencies:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     near-sdk = "4.0.0"
     serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
     ```

3. **Implement the Smart Contract**:
   - Start with `src/lib.rs` to define the contract structure and import modules.
   - Implement each module in its respective file (`world_creation.rs`, `game_assets.rs`, etc.) according to the specifications provided.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use the `src/errors.rs` file to define custom error types.
   - Implement error handling in each function to return appropriate errors when conditions are not met (e.g., unauthorized access, invalid input).

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for each module to ensure functionality.
   - Use NEAR's testing framework to simulate contract interactions.

6. **Deploying the Contract**:
   - Use NEAR CLI to deploy your contract to the NEAR blockchain.
   - Ensure you have a NEAR account and sufficient funds for deployment.

7. **Interacting with the Contract**:
   - Create a frontend application or use NEAR CLI to interact with your deployed contract.
   - Test all functionalities, including world creation, asset minting, and user registration.

## Usage Examples

- **Creating a World**:
  Call the `create_world` function with the desired parameters to create a new virtual world.

- **Minting an Asset**:
  Use the `mint_asset` function to create a new NFT linked to a specific world.

- **Updating a World**:
  Call `update_world` to modify the details of an existing world.

## Possible Errors and Fixes

- **Compilation Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in `Cargo.toml` and that your Rust code adheres to the syntax rules.
- **Permission Errors**: Check that the `env::signer_account_id()` matches the expected owner for functions that require ownership.
- **Data Storage Issues**: Ensure that all data structures are correctly defined and that you handle serialization/deserialization properly.

By following these steps, you can build a comprehensive smart contract for your AI gaming metaverse on the NEAR blockchain.
